# The following installed packages are installed so that downstream images
#   don't need to install some of the more basic packages that are needed for
#   nearly all build processes. These packages may evolve over time as the
#   average install process changes, but these packages should be kept minimal,
#   and should be relatively limited.
# Running apt-get upgrade is recommended against in the official Docker docs
#   docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#apt-get
#   so it was removed from this layer.
