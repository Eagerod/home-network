# Home network configuration templates

**Note:** In the interest of brevity, where not otherwise explicitly stated, this readme should be read as though it strictly focuses on running on Linux.

This repo holds configurations for my home network.
It includes docker images, or host-modifying make commands that will allow any machine to be turned into a home network host without needing to configure much else.

*Note:* There's still a lot of "much else", but every time something new is done, the hope if that the gap of "much else" closes.
