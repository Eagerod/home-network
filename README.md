# Home network configuration templates

This repo holds configurations for my home network.
It includes docker images, or host-modifying make commands that will allow any machine to be turned into a home network host without needing to configure much else.

# TODO
- Create a git user that can be used with a proper home directory that can be used to keep git URLs on clients simple, rather than needing to know the directory structure of the host machine.
