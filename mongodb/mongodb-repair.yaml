# This has been left in an untested, and mostly commented out state.
# This job should, in its ultimate form:
#   - Scale down the existing mongodb statefulset *if it exists*
#   - Run the mongod repair command
#   - Rescale up the mongodb stateful set *if it previously existed*
# This could actually be done as an ops job, rather than a deployment
