# Generic, and hopefully extremely reusable .dockerignore file.
# Each section outlines a collection of somewhat related files that should be
#   excluded from nearly every Docker image that ends up being built.
# Commenting out certain lines may be reasonable under some circumstances.
# Sections are kind of sorted according to how project-specific they are, so
#   items higher up in the list should nearly never need to be commented away.
